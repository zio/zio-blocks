title: "SQL Data Migration"
---

The `zio.blocks.data.migration` module provides three execution models for evolving database schemas online. It builds on [`Migration[A, B]`](./schema/migration.md) for the typed row transformation and [`Repo[E, ID]`](./sql/index.md) for database access. No hand-written SQL, no XML, no Liquibase-style migration files.

## Overview

Data migration in ZIO Blocks is split into three execution tiers, each suited to a different scale of change:

| Model | Class | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **A-Tiny** | `TinyMigrator` | DDL-only changes at startup (add column, rename table) |
| **A-Small** | `SmallMigrator` | Queue-based batch backfill for moderate tables |
| **B-Large** | `LargeMigrator` | Incremental worker with pause/resume and safe cutover for large tables |

All three share the same building blocks:

- `Migration[A, B]` from `zio.blocks.schema.migration` defines the typed transformation
- `Repo[E, ID]` from `zio.blocks.sql` provides database access for source and target
- `TargetStrategy` controls whether rows are updated in place or written to a shadow table
- `QueueTable` tracks dirty keys that need processing

The module is Scala 3 only.

## Execution Models

### A-Tiny: `TinyMigrator`

`TinyMigrator` runs DDL migrations at application startup through `Transactor.transact`. Extend it and override `run()` to issue schema changes:

```scala
import zio.blocks.data.migration._
import zio.blocks.sql._

class AddAgeColumn(transactor: Transactor) extends TinyMigrator(transactor) {
  def run()(using tx: DbTx): Unit =
    // DDL statements executed at startup
    ???
}

new AddAgeColumn(transactor).migrate()
```

Tiny migrations are appropriate when the schema change is fast, non-blocking, and can run before the application starts serving requests.

### A-Small: `SmallMigrator`

`SmallMigrator` is a queue-based batch worker for moderate-sized tables. It reads dirty keys from a `QueueTable`, fetches the source row, applies the `Migration[A, B]`, and writes the result to the target.

The lifecycle has three steps:

1. `init()` prepares the target table (creates a shadow table for `ShadowTable` strategy)
2. `processBatch()` claims and processes a batch of dirty keys
3. `complete()` finalizes the migration (swaps shadow table if applicable)

Call `processBatch()` in a loop until the queue is empty, then call `complete()` (`complete()` refuses to run while items are still pending):

```scala
import zio.blocks.data.migration._

// Assuming smallMigrator is already constructed (see full example below)
smallMigrator.init()

// Process batches until the queue drains
var pending = true
while (pending) {
  val count = smallMigrator.processBatch()
  pending = count > 0
}

smallMigrator.complete()
```

`SmallMigrator` supports both `TargetStrategy.InPlace` and `TargetStrategy.ShadowTable`.

### B-Large: `LargeMigrator`

`LargeMigrator` is an incremental worker designed for large tables where a full backfill would take too long. It adds pause/resume capability, concurrent worker support on PostgreSQL via `SKIP LOCKED`, and a safe completion protocol that guarantees no data is lost during cutover.

The lifecycle has four steps:

1. `init()` prepares the target table (creates a shadow table for `ShadowTable` strategy)
2. `fence()` signals cutover and stops new producers from writing to the old table
3. `drain()` processes all remaining queue items until the queue is empty
4. `complete()` swaps the shadow table and finalizes the migration

```scala
import zio.blocks.data.migration._

// Assuming largeMigrator is already constructed (see full example below)
largeMigrator.init()

// ... application runs, dirty keys accumulate ...

// Cutover: stop writers, drain remaining, swap
largeMigrator.fence()
val totalDrained = largeMigrator.drain()
largeMigrator.complete()
```

`LargeMigrator` is typically used with `TargetStrategy.ShadowTable` for safe cutover. The completion protocol ensures every dirty key is processed before the shadow table replaces the source.

## Target Strategies

`TargetStrategy` controls where migrated rows are written:

- **`TargetStrategy.InPlace`** updates rows directly in the source table. Suitable when the schema change is backward compatible and the table structure does not change.
- **`TargetStrategy.ShadowTable(suffix)`** creates a shadow table with the target schema, writes migrated rows there, and swaps the shadow table in at completion. The suffix is appended to the source table name to derive the shadow table name. Suitable when the schema change is not backward compatible or when you need a clean cutover.

```scala
TargetStrategy.InPlace
TargetStrategy.ShadowTable("v2")   // shadow table will be named: users_v2
```

## Safe Completion Protocol (B-Large)

`LargeMigrator` follows a stateful protocol to guarantee zero data loss during cutover. The protocol moves through four states:

```
Initialized → Fenced → Drained → Completed
```

### `init()` (Initialized)

Prepares the target table. For `TargetStrategy.ShadowTable`, creates the shadow table. The source table continues to accept writes normally — producers are not interrupted. Workers call `init()` once before processing any batches.

### `fence()` (Fenced)

Signals that cutover is starting. The application **must** stop writing to the source table before calling `fence()`. After fencing, `drain()` will process all remaining queue entries until the queue is confirmed empty. Writes arriving after `fence()` may not be migrated.

### `drain()` (Drained)

Processes all remaining dirty keys until the queue is empty. Returns the total number of rows processed. Because fencing stopped new writes, the queue is guaranteed to reach zero.

### `complete()` (Completed)

Swaps the shadow table to replace the source table. After completion, the migration is done and the target table is live. Trigger cleanup and queue table removal are not performed automatically — callers are responsible for dropping these after verifying the migration is complete.

The protocol ensures that every row modified between `init()` and `complete()` is migrated, even if the application crashes and restarts mid-migration. The queue table persists across restarts.

## ID Type Flexibility

`LargeMigrator` and `SmallMigrator` accept separate `ID1` and `ID2` type parameters for the source and target repos, but construction requires evidence that they are the same type (`ID1 =:= ID2`):

```scala
SmallMigrator[UserV1, UserV2, Long, Long](...)
LargeMigrator[UserV1, UserV2, Long, Long](...)
```

The queue table stores V1 IDs (`ID1`). The `ID1` type must have a `DbCodec` instance available as a given. The equality constraint keeps delete propagation type-safe: when a source row disappears between dequeue and read, the same key is reinterpreted for the target repo via the type evidence rather than a cast. Migrations that change the primary key type are out of scope for the built-in migrators.

## Queue Primitives

`QueueTable` is the dirty-key tracking mechanism shared by `SmallMigrator` and `LargeMigrator`. The queue table has three columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY` | The primary key of the affected source row |
| `op` | `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'I'` | The operation type: `'I'` (insert), `'U'` (update), or `'D'` (delete) |
| `payload` | `TEXT` | JSON-serialized V1 row data, captured only for `'D'` operations on PostgreSQL |

Queue entries are coalesced by primary key. There are two ways keys enter the queue:

1. **Manual enqueue** — the application calls `QueueTable.enqueue` for every row it writes (or for a batch of rows to backfill).
2. **Capture triggers** — pass `captureTriggers = true` when constructing `SmallMigrator` or `LargeMigrator`; `init()` then installs triggers via `QueueTable.installTriggers` so every source INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE upserts the affected key in the writer's own transaction. Trigger installation is idempotent (PostgreSQL requires PG 14+ for `CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER`). Do not enable capture triggers when the migrator writes to the same physical table it captures from: the worker's own writes would re-enqueue processed keys forever.

For `INSERT` and `UPDATE`, only the key and operation type are stored. For `DELETE`, PostgreSQL additionally captures the full row as JSON via `row_to_json(OLD)::text` into the `payload` column; the payload is reserved for future delete-recovery and is not read by the current workers. SQLite does not support `row_to_json`, so its delete entries carry no payload.

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| `QueueTable.create` | Creates the queue table (id, op, payload columns) |
| `enqueue` | Inserts the ID into the queue |
| `dequeue` | Claims and removes a batch of IDs, returning `List[ID]` |
| `pending` | Returns the number of unprocessed keys |
| `installTriggers` | Installs capture triggers on the source table |

PostgreSQL uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for concurrent worker claims. SQLite uses a single consumer with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and a busy timeout. Queue IDs are stored as TEXT, so batches are claimed in lexicographic order (`'10'` before `'9'`); this affects claim order only, never correctness.

A worker claims the dirty key and, in one transaction, looks up the source row by ID, applies the `Migration[A, B]`, and writes the result to the target. If the source row is missing at processing time (deleted between enqueue and dequeue), the corresponding target row is deleted — `findAll` returns only rows that still exist.

## Database Support

| Feature | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
|---|---|---|
| `TinyMigrator` | Yes | Yes |
| `SmallMigrator` | Yes | Yes |
| `LargeMigrator` | Yes (multi-worker) | Yes (single-worker) |
| `SKIP LOCKED` | Yes | No |
| `ShadowTable` (CREATE TABLE LIKE, atomic swap) | Yes | No |
| `InPlace` updates | Yes | Yes |

PostgreSQL supports the full feature set including concurrent workers, shadow table creation via `CREATE TABLE LIKE`, and atomic DDL swap. SQLite supports queue primitives and in-place updates but does not support shadow tables or concurrent workers.

## Contextual Requirements

`TinyMigrator`, `SmallMigrator`, and `LargeMigrator` require a `Transactor` as an implicit constructor parameter. `SmallMigrator` and `LargeMigrator` also require a `DbCodec[ID1]` given for the queue table's primary key column.

## Full Example

```scala
import zio.blocks.schema._
import zio.blocks.schema.migration.Migration
import zio.blocks.sql.{DbCodec, DbCodecDeriver, Repo, Table, Transactor}
import zio.blocks.data.migration._

case class UserV1(id: Int, name: String)
case class UserV2(id: Int, name: String, age: Int)

object UserV1 { implicit val schema: Schema[UserV1] = Schema.derived }
object UserV2 { implicit val schema: Schema[UserV2] = Schema.derived }

val v1Table = Table.derived[UserV1]
val v2Table = Table.derived[UserV2]

implicit val codecInt: DbCodec[Int] = implicitly[Schema[Int]].deriving(DbCodecDeriver).derive
implicit val codecV1: DbCodec[UserV1] = UserV1.schema.deriving(DbCodecDeriver).derive
implicit val codecV2: DbCodec[UserV2] = UserV2.schema.deriving(DbCodecDeriver).derive

val v1Repo = Repo(v1Table, "id", summon[DbCodec[Int]], (_: UserV1).id)
val v2Repo = Repo(v2Table, "id", summon[DbCodec[Int]], (_: UserV2).id)

// Migration that transforms UserV1 to UserV2
val migration: Migration[UserV1, UserV2] = Migration
  .newBuilder[UserV1, UserV2]
  .addField(_.age, SchemaExpr.literal(0))
  .build

// SmallMigrator: queue-based batch processing
val smallMigrator = SmallMigrator[UserV1, UserV2, Int, Int](
  repoV1 = v1Repo,
  repoV2 = v2Repo,
  migration = migration,
  queueTable = "user_migration_q",
  batchSize = 100,
  target = TargetStrategy.ShadowTable("v2")
)(using transactor, summon[DbCodec[Int]], Dialect.Postgres)

// Lifecycle: init, process batches, complete
smallMigrator.init()
// ... loop processBatch() ...
smallMigrator.complete()

// LargeMigrator: incremental worker with safe completion protocol
val largeMigrator = LargeMigrator[UserV1, UserV2, Int, Int](
  repoV1 = v1Repo,
  repoV2 = v2Repo,
  migration = migration,
  queueTable = "user_migration_q",
  batchSize = 100,
  target = TargetStrategy.ShadowTable("v2"),
  captureTriggers = true
)(using transactor, summon[DbCodec[Int]], Dialect.Postgres)

// Safe lifecycle: init, fence, drain, complete
largeMigrator.init()
largeMigrator.fence()
val total = largeMigrator.drain()
largeMigrator.complete()
```

## Failure Policy

When a worker transaction fails, the transaction is rolled back and the dirty key is retained in the queue table. The failure is returned to the caller. No data is silently lost, and no automatic retry or dead-letter configuration is applied. The caller decides how to handle the failure.
