`RingBuffer[A]` is a **fixed-size, lock-free queue** for efficiently exchanging elements between producer and consumer threads with minimal contention and cache-line effects. Ring buffers use a circular array to recycle memory, eliminating garbage collection pressure from transient allocations. The module provides four specialized implementations tuned for different producer/consumer thread patterns.

```scala
final class SpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def offer(a: A): Boolean
  def take(): A
  def size: Int
  def isEmpty: Boolean
  def isFull: Boolean
  def drain(consumer: A => Unit, limit: Int): Int
  def fill(supplier: () => A, limit: Int): Int
}

final class SpmcRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def offer(a: A): Boolean
  def take(): A
  def size: Int
  def isEmpty: Boolean
  def isFull: Boolean
}

final class MpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def offer(a: A): Boolean
  def take(): A
  def size: Int
  def isEmpty: Boolean
  def isFull: Boolean
  def drain(consumer: A => Unit, limit: Int): Int
}

final class MpmcRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def offer(a: A): Boolean
  def take(): A
  def size: Int
  def isEmpty: Boolean
  def isFull: Boolean
}
```

## Motivation

Building low-latency systems — trading platforms, game engines, real-time event processors — requires careful control over memory allocation and CPU cache behavior. Standard JVM collections like `LinkedList` or `ArrayDeque` are convenient but have a cost: every enqueue/dequeue pair allocates a node, triggering garbage collection pauses that can destroy millisecond-scale latencies.

A naive approach is to pre-allocate a large `Array[A]` and manually manage head/tail indices:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
var head = 0
var tail = 0
val array = new Array[String](1024)

def offer(x: String): Boolean = {
  if (tail - head >= array.length) false  // full
  else {
    array(tail % array.length) = x
    tail += 1
    true
  }
}

def take(): String = {
  if (head == tail) null  // empty
  else {
    val x = array(head % array.length)
    head += 1
    x
  }
}
```

This works for single-threaded code, but introduces a critical problem under concurrency: both threads read and write `head` and `tail` without synchronization, leading to lost updates, stale reads, and silent data corruption. Adding `synchronized` blocks solves the data race but reintroduces contention and latency pauses.

Ring buffers solve both problems with **lock-free algorithms** and **cache-line padding**. A ring buffer provides:
- **No garbage collection** — reuses the same array forever
- **Lock-free access** — uses atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) for coordination, avoiding mutex contention
- **Predictable latency** — no surprise GC pauses or lock waits
- **Thread-specialized variants** — choose SPSC, MPSC, SPMC, or MPMC based on your thread pattern

This module provides four implementations tuned for maximum throughput and minimal latency across all producer/consumer combinations.

## Why FastFlow?

Understanding the FastFlow algorithm helps explain why `SpscRingBuffer` achieves such high performance.

Imagine two threads sharing data with a traditional lock-based queue like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. They use a mutex (lock) to coordinate:

1. Producer thread: acquires lock, adds element, releases lock
2. Consumer thread: acquires lock, removes element, releases lock

This works, but locks have a cost: when threads contend for the same lock, one thread **blocks** (goes to sleep) while waiting. Waking a thread is expensive (thousands of CPU cycles). Even lock-free queues using `synchronized` or `volatile` reads can cause **cache-coherency traffic**: when one CPU core writes to a variable another core reads, the entire cache line must be invalidated and transferred — a costly operation that slows down both cores.

The fundamental issue: **if the producer has to read what the consumer wrote (or vice versa), their CPU caches constantly fight**. This is called *false sharing* and can reduce throughput by 10x or more on heavily loaded systems.

The problem is that *any* read by the producer of the consumer's state (or vice versa) causes cache line bouncing. So FastFlow's radical idea: **neither side should ever read the other's state**.

Instead, the producer simply **writes data into slots** and marks them non-null. The consumer independently **reads slots** and takes any non-null values. The array slot's null/non-null status itself is the only coordination needed — a *happens-before* relationship written once by the producer, read once by the consumer. No locks, no atomic operations on the fast path, no reading the other side's counters.

The **note-passing analogy**:
- You (producer) have a row of empty desks between you and your friend (consumer)
- Empty desk = `null` (available)
- Note on desk = non-null value (message ready)
- **You never look at your friend's side** — you just place notes on empty desks
- **Your friend never looks at your side** — they just pick up notes they see
- No shouting "are you ready?", no waiting, no lock contention

**This is how FastFlow solves the cache-coherency problem**: since producer and consumer never read each other's counters, there's no cache line bouncing between CPU cores. All coordination happens through the slots themselves, which are written once and read once.

The **look-ahead cache** is a further optimization: the producer maintains a local cached limit (`producerLimit`) so they don't have to check every slot individually. It's like glancing ahead at the next N desks to see if they're empty, without actually bending over to look. This keeps the fast path extremely fast — just a local counter check and an array write.

**Why FastFlow is fast**:
- **No locks** — no thread ever blocks another
- **Minimal cache coordination** — producer and consumer touch separate memory locations; the array slot is written once, read once
- **Write-once, read-once semantics** — the slot's null/non-null status is the handshake
- **Cache-line padding** — producer and consumer indices padded to separate cache lines, eliminating false sharing

The result: **lock-free, wait-free** communication that scales linearly with CPU count and achieves nanosecond-scale latencies. This is why FastFlow is the algorithm of choice for SPSC ring buffers in high-performance systems like trading platforms, game engines, and network stacks.

## Overview

Ring buffers are high-performance data structures for:

- **Event queues** in IO, networking, and game engines where throughput and latency matter
- **Thread-safe work queues** with bounded capacity to backpressure senders
- **Inter-thread communication** between producers and consumers with predictable latency
- **Concurrent batch processing** where producers fill elements and consumers drain them

### Core Principles

- **Fixed capacity** — allocated upfront, no dynamic resizing or garbage collection churn
- **Lock-free** — no mutexes or blocking, uses atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) for coordination
- **Circular memory** — slots wrap around when indices exceed the capacity, reusing the same array
- **FIFO ordering** — elements are taken in the order they were offered
- **Non-nullable elements** — all implementations reject `null` inputs

## Why Ring Buffers

Ring buffers excel when you need:

- **Ultra-low latency** — lock-free algorithms and cache-line padding eliminate pauses from contention
- **Predictable throughput** — no GC overhead since the same memory array is reused forever
- **Bounded resources** — fixed capacity prevents runaway memory growth and enables backpressure
- **High concurrency** — multiple implementations optimized for different thread patterns (SPSC, MPMC, etc.)

### Comparison with Java and Scala Alternatives

| Property                | RingBuffer (ZIO Blocks)                | `java.util.Queue` (ConcurrentLinkedQueue) | `scala.collection.concurrent.TrieMap` | Array + manual index     | Disruptor                |

| **Predictable latency** | High (no GC)                           | Medium (GC pauses)                        | Medium (GC pauses)                    | High (if no contention)  | High                     |

RingBuffer is ideal when you control both producer and consumer thread counts and want maximum performance. `java.util.Queue` is better if you need unbounded capacity; Disruptor is a comparable JVM alternative with similar guarantees.

## Implementation Algorithms

ZIO Blocks provides four ring buffer implementations, each optimized for a specific producer/consumer thread pattern. The choice of algorithm depends on how many producer and consumer threads you have:

| Implementation | Producers | Consumers | Algorithm | Producer Coordination | Consumer Coordination | Slot Clearing | Use Case |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| **`SpscRingBuffer`** | 1 | 1 | FastFlow | Single-threaded, no CAS | Null-slot reads, never reads `producerIndex` | Consumer clears | Fastest 1:1 channel |
| **`SpmcRingBuffer`** | 1 | N | Index-based CAS | Single-threaded, cached limit | CAS on `consumerIndex` (read-before-CAS) | Producer overwrites | One producer → many workers |
| **`MpscRingBuffer`** | N | 1 | JCTools MpscArrayQueue | CAS on `producerIndex` + cached limit | FastFlow relaxed-poll (null-slot) | Consumer clears | Many producers → single aggregator |
| **`MpmcRingBuffer`** | N | N | Vyukov/Dmitry | CAS + sequence buffer | CAS + sequence buffer | Both clear | General-purpose MPMC queue |

**Using the wrong implementation for your thread pattern may result in data races, silent data loss, or crashes.** Always match the number of threads to the ring buffer variant.

### `SpscRingBuffer`: FastFlow Pattern

`SpscRingBuffer` uses the **FastFlow** pattern, originally developed for the C++ FastFlow framework and popularized in Java by JCTools and the LMAX Disruptor. The core insight: the array element's `null`/non-`null` state **is** the synchronization signal. The producer never reads `consumerIndex`; the consumer never reads `producerIndex`. This eliminates all cross-core cache traffic between the two sides.

**How it works:**

- The producer walks forward through the array, placing elements into slots that are currently `null`. It marks a slot non-`null` after writing. The producer never reads what the consumer has consumed — it only checks its own cached `producerLimit` to know how many slots are available.
- The consumer walks forward through the array, reading any slot that contains a non-`null` value. After reading, it writes `null` to clear the slot. The consumer never reads the producer's index.
- The slot's nullness itself is the coordination: written once by the producer, read once by the consumer. No locks, no atomic operations on the fast path, no reading the other side's counters.

**Look-ahead cache:** The producer maintains a local `producerLimit` (derived from `consumerIndex` during slow path). This allows the fast path to check a simple local counter instead of reading the volatile `consumerIndex` on every `offer`. The look-ahead step is `min(capacity/4, 4096)`, balancing between reducing consumer reads and memory usage.

See [Why FastFlow?](#why-fastflow) for a deeper conceptual explanation.

### `SpmcRingBuffer`: Index-Based with CAS Consumers

`SpmcRingBuffer` allows a single producer to feed multiple consumers. The algorithm is **index-based**: slot validity is determined by comparing `producerIndex` and `consumerIndex`, not by null-checking slots.

**How it works:**

- The **producer** is single-threaded and never uses CAS. It maintains a `producerLimit` derived from reading the volatile `consumerIndex`. On the fast path, it checks its local limit; when exhausted, it refreshes by reading `consumerIndex`. This design avoids the producer ever reading consumer state on the fast path.
- The **consumers** (any number) coordinate via a CAS loop on `consumerIndex`. Each consumer reads the element at its claimed index, then attempts to CAS `consumerIndex` forward. If CAS fails, it retries with a refreshed index. This ensures each element is claimed by exactly one consumer.
- **No slot clearing by consumers:** Consumers do not write `null` after reading. Instead, the producer safely overwrites slots once its `producerLimit` check (based on `consumerIndex`) confirms all consumers have advanced past them. This eliminates the race that would occur if a consumer claimed a slot but hadn't yet cleared it.

**Trade-off:** Consumer CAS introduces overhead under contention, but the producer remains extremely fast (no synchronization).

### `MpscRingBuffer`: Hybrid FastFlow

`MpscRingBuffer` handles multiple producers with a single consumer, based on the **JCTools `MpscArrayQueue`** design. It's a hybrid: producers use CAS among themselves, while the consumer remains FastFlow-style.

**How it works:**

- The **producers** (multiple) coordinate via CAS on the shared `producerIndex`. Each producer claims a slot by atomically incrementing `producerIndex`, then writes its element with release semantics. A cached `producerLimit` (initialized to capacity) reduces volatile reads of `consumerIndex`.
- The **consumer** (single) uses **FastFlow relaxed-poll semantics**: it reads array slots directly. A `null` slot indicates either the buffer is empty or a producer has claimed the slot via CAS but has not yet written the element (mid-write). In both cases, `take` returns `null` rather than spinning. The consumer clears the slot after reading.
- The `producerLimit` is updated opportunistically (racy updates are benign) to reflect approximate available capacity.

**Why hybrid?** Multiple producers need CAS to coordinate their offers, but the single consumer can achieve maximum speed using pure FastFlow (no CAS, no reading producer state).

### `MpmcRingBuffer`: Vyukov/Dmitry Sequence Buffer

`MpmcRingBuffer` handles the hardest case: **many producers and many consumers** all accessing the same buffer at once. It uses the **Vyukov/Dmitry algorithm**, which is a lock-free MPMC queue design.

The challenge: when multiple producers might try to write to the same slot, and multiple consumers might try to read the same slot, we need a fair way to say "this slot is mine" without using locks.

**The trick: Give each slot a "ticket number" that changes in a predictable cycle.**

The algorithm runs two parallel arrays of the same length:

- `buffer[i]` — holds the actual element at position `i`
- `seqBuf[i]` — holds a *sequence stamp* at position `i`

The sequence stamps are the heart of the algorithm. Each stamp encodes the *ownership state* of its slot: who is allowed to act on it and what they are allowed to do.

On initialization, `seqBuf[i]` is set to `i`. The producer index `pIdx` and consumer index `cIdx` both start at zero. From here, every operation follows the same pattern: read the stamp, compute a single difference (`diff`), and branch on whether `diff` is zero, negative, or positive.

At any moment, slot `i` (where `i = index & mask`) is in exactly one of three states:

| stamp value                 | meaning                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| if `seq == pIdx`            | Slot is free — the producer at `pIdx` may write  |
| if `seq == cIdx + 1`        | Data written — the consumer at `cIdx` may read   |
| if `seq == cIdx + capacity` | Slot consumed — free for the producer's next lap |

The producer looks for `diff = seq - pIdx == 0`. The consumer looks for `diff = seq - (cIdx + 1) == 0`. In both cases, a negative diff means the other side has fallen behind (buffer full or empty), and a positive diff means another thread already claimed this slot and you should retry.

#### Diagram

To see the sequence buffer in action, use this interactive stepper. The component below implements the algorithm faithfully in React. Type any label, click **Offer** to enqueue or **Take** to dequeue, and watch the trace panel show every intermediate variable — `pIdx`, `slot`, `seq`, `diff` — and the exact decision the algorithm makes from them.

<MpmcDiagram />

Click "Step Producer" and "Step Consumer" to see how the algorithm coordinates access handoff without locks.

Here is a complete walkthrough of every variable in the trace, in the order the algorithm computes them.

#### `pIdx` / `cIdx` — the monotonic counters

These two numbers are the heartbeat of the entire algorithm. `pIdx` is the producer's counter and `cIdx` is the consumer's counter. They start at zero and *only ever increase* — they never wrap, never reset, never go backwards. After a million operations `pIdx` might be 1,000,000 and `cIdx` might be 999,996. The raw slot position is derived from them rather than stored directly, which is what makes the algorithm safe for multiple concurrent threads.

#### `slot = idx & mask` — the circular array index

Because the buffer has a power-of-two capacity (4 in the demo), `mask = capacity - 1 = 3`, which in binary is `0011`. The bitwise AND strips everything above the lowest two bits, giving a number in the range `[0, 3]`. This is mathematically identical to `idx % capacity` but costs a single CPU instruction instead of a division. So `pIdx = 7` maps to slot `7 & 3 = 3`, and `pIdx = 8` maps back to slot `8 & 3 = 0` — that is the wrap-around.

#### `seq = seqBuf[slot]` — the sequence stamp

Every slot carries its own stamp, completely independent of the other slots. The stamp is not a lock and not a boolean "occupied/free" flag — it is a number that encodes the *exact generation* of the slot. On construction `seqBuf[i] = i`, so slot 0 starts at 0, slot 1 at 1, and so on. After each write the stamp advances by 1. After each consume it advances by `capacity`. Because of this, slot 0's stamp trail across three laps looks like `0 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 8 → 9 → 12 → 13 …` — it grows forever and never repeats, which is what prevents the ABA problem entirely.


#### `expected` (take only) `= cIdx + 1`

The producer, after winning its CAS and writing data, stamps the slot with `pIdx + 1`. So if a producer claimed slot 0 when `pIdx` was 4, it leaves `seqBuf[0] = 5`. The consumer that arrives with `cIdx = 4` therefore looks for `seqBuf[0] == cIdx + 1 == 5`. The `+ 1` is the handshake signal: *"a producer has finished writing here, and you are the right consumer to read it."* The offer trace does not need an `expected` row because the producer compares `seq` directly against `pIdx` (not `pIdx + 1`) — the slot is free when the stamp equals the producer index exactly.


#### `diff` — the three-way decision

This is the key insight of the Vyukov algorithm. A single subtraction replaces what would otherwise be a tangle of conditional checks.

For **offer**: `diff = seq − pIdx`
- `diff == 0` — the stamp exactly matches the producer index, meaning no one has touched this slot since it was last released. The slot is yours. The thread does a CAS on `pIdx`, writes the element, then stamps `seqBuf[slot] = pIdx + 1`.
- `diff < 0` — the stamp is *behind* the producer index. This means the slot is still occupied by data from the current lap that has not been consumed yet. The buffer is full. Return `false`.
- `diff > 0` — the stamp is *ahead* of the producer index. Another producer already claimed this slot and advanced past it. Retry the loop with a fresh read of `pIdx`.

For **take**: `diff = seq − expected` where `expected = cIdx + 1`
- `diff == 0` — the stamp matches exactly what the producer left. Data is ready. CAS on `cIdx`, read the element, null out the slot for GC, stamp `seqBuf[slot] = cIdx + capacity` to release the slot for a future producer on the next lap.
- `diff < 0` — the stamp is behind what the consumer expects, meaning the producer has not finished writing yet (or has not written at all). The buffer appears empty from this consumer's perspective. Return `null`.
- `diff > 0` — another consumer already read this slot and advanced past it. Retry.

#### Why all three decisions are safe without any lock

The diff check and the subsequent CAS form an atomic claim. Two producers might both read the same `pIdx` and both see `diff == 0`, but only one will win the CAS that advances `pIdx`. The loser sees the CAS fail, loops back, reads the new `pIdx`, and naturally ends up looking at the next slot. No explicit coordination between threads is ever needed — the sequence stamps and the monotonically increasing indices together make every slot's state self-describing at any point in time.

## Installation

Add the ZIO Blocks Ring Buffer module to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-blocks-ringbuffer" % "@VERSION@"
```

For Scala.js cross-platform support:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %%% "zio-blocks-ringbuffer" % "@VERSION@"
```

## Creating Instances

Ring buffers are instantiated via the companion object's `apply` method:

### `SpscRingBuffer` — Single Producer, Single Consumer

`SpscRingBuffer[A]` uses the FastFlow pattern with a look-ahead cache. On the fast path, the producer checks a cached `producerLimit` to avoid reading `consumerIndex`. When the cached limit is exhausted, the slow path reads the array slot at `producerIndex + lookAheadStep` (where `lookAheadStep = min(capacity/4, 4096)`) — never `consumerIndex` directly. This keeps the producer and consumer cache lines fully independent. The consumer uses null/non-null slot reads (FastFlow semantics). Together, these avoid repeated volatile reads and minimize cross-core cache traffic. For algorithmic details, see [Implementation Algorithms](#implementation-algorithms).

```scala
object SpscRingBuffer {
  def apply[A <: AnyRef](capacity: Int): SpscRingBuffer[A]
}
```

Creates a new SPSC ring buffer with the given capacity. The capacity must be a positive power of two.

We create an SPSC buffer as follows:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.SpscRingBuffer

val rb = SpscRingBuffer[String](16)  // capacity must be power of 2
```

### `SpmcRingBuffer` — Single Producer, Multiple Consumers

`SpmcRingBuffer[A]` allows a single producer thread to offer elements while multiple consumer threads concurrently take elements via compare-and-swap on the consumer index. For algorithmic details, see [Implementation Algorithms](#implementation-algorithms).

```scala
object SpmcRingBuffer {
  def apply[A <: AnyRef](capacity: Int): SpmcRingBuffer[A]
}
```

Creates a new SPMC ring buffer with the given capacity. The capacity must be a positive power of two.

We create an SPMC buffer as follows:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.SpmcRingBuffer

val rb = SpmcRingBuffer[java.lang.Integer](64)
```

### `MpscRingBuffer` — Multiple Producers, Single Consumer

`MpscRingBuffer[A]` allows multiple producer threads to offer elements concurrently via compare-and-swap on the producer index, while a single consumer thread takes elements efficiently. For algorithmic details, see [Implementation Algorithms](#implementation-algorithms).

```scala
object MpscRingBuffer {
  def apply[A <: AnyRef](capacity: Int): MpscRingBuffer[A]
}
```

Creates a new MPSC ring buffer with the given capacity. The capacity must be a positive power of two.

We create an MPSC buffer as follows:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.MpscRingBuffer

val rb = MpscRingBuffer[java.lang.Long](32)
```

### `MpmcRingBuffer` — Multiple Producers, Multiple Consumers

`MpmcRingBuffer[A]` is the fully general-purpose implementation supporting any number of producers and consumers. It uses the Vyukov/Dmitry algorithm with a parallel sequence buffer to coordinate access safely. For algorithmic details, see [Implementation Algorithms](#implementation-algorithms).

```scala
object MpmcRingBuffer {
  def apply[A <: AnyRef](capacity: Int): MpmcRingBuffer[A]
}
```

Creates a new MPMC ring buffer with the given capacity. The capacity must be a power of two >= 2 (the sequence buffer algorithm requires at least 2 slots).

We create an MPMC buffer as follows:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.MpmcRingBuffer

val rb = MpmcRingBuffer[String](128)
```

### Capacity Requirements

All implementations require capacity to be a positive power of two. Valid and invalid capacities look like:

```scala
SpscRingBuffer[String](16)   // OK: 2^4 = 16
SpscRingBuffer[String](1024) // OK: 2^10 = 1024
SpscRingBuffer[String](15)   // Error: not power of 2
SpscRingBuffer[String](0)    // Error: must be > 0
```

`MpmcRingBuffer` additionally requires capacity >= 2 to distinguish between empty and full states in its sequence buffer algorithm.

## Core Operations

Ring buffers provide the same core API across all four implementations: `offer`, `take`, `size`, `isEmpty`, and `isFull`. The SPSC variant additionally provides batch operations `drain` and `fill`.

### Inserting Elements — `offer`

`SpscRingBuffer#offer` — Insert an element (SPSC) with this signature:

```scala
final class SpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def offer(a: A): Boolean
}
```

Inserts the element without blocking. Returns `true` if inserted, `false` if the buffer is full. Throws `NullPointerException` if the element is `null`. Must be called from the producer thread only.

`SpmcRingBuffer#offer` — Insert an element (SPMC) with this signature:

```scala
final class SpmcRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def offer(a: A): Boolean
}
```

Inserts the element without blocking. Returns `true` if inserted, `false` if the buffer is full. Throws `NullPointerException` if the element is `null`. May be called from the single producer thread only; concurrent calls from multiple threads cause undefined behavior.

`MpscRingBuffer#offer` — Insert an element (MPSC) with this signature:

```scala
final class MpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def offer(a: A): Boolean
}
```

Inserts the element without blocking. Returns `true` if inserted, `false` if the buffer is full. Throws `NullPointerException` if the element is `null`. Thread-safe; multiple producer threads may call this concurrently.

`MpmcRingBuffer#offer` — Insert an element (MPMC) with this signature:

```scala
final class MpmcRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def offer(a: A): Boolean
}
```

Inserts the element without blocking. Returns `true` if inserted, `false` if the buffer is full. Throws `NullPointerException` if the element is `null`. Thread-safe; multiple producer threads may call this concurrently.

We can offer elements and check the return value to handle backpressure:

```scala mdoc:silent:reset
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.SpscRingBuffer

val rb = SpscRingBuffer[String](4)
```

When the buffer becomes full, `offer` returns `false`:

```scala mdoc
val result1 = rb.offer("a")  // true
val result2 = rb.offer("b")  // true
val result3 = rb.offer("c")  // true
val result4 = rb.offer("d")  // true
val result5 = rb.offer("e")  // false (Buffer is full, capacity = 4)
```

### Removing Elements — `take`

`SpscRingBuffer#take` — Remove an element (SPSC) with this signature:

```scala
final class SpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def take(): A
}
```

Retrieves and removes an element from the front of the buffer. Returns immediately without blocking. Returns the element, or `null` if the buffer is empty. Must be called from the consumer thread only.

`SpmcRingBuffer#take` — Remove an element (SPMC) with this signature:

```scala
final class SpmcRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def take(): A
}
```

Retrieves and removes an element from the front of the buffer. Returns immediately without blocking. Returns the element, or `null` if the buffer is empty. Thread-safe; multiple consumer threads may call this concurrently.

`MpscRingBuffer#take` — Remove an element (MPSC) with this signature:

```scala
final class MpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def take(): A
}
```

Retrieves and removes an element from the front of the buffer. Returns immediately without blocking. Returns the element, or `null` if the buffer is empty. Must be called from the single consumer thread only.

`MpmcRingBuffer#take` — Remove an element (MPMC) with this signature:

```scala
final class MpmcRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def take(): A
}
```

Retrieves and removes an element from the front of the buffer. Returns immediately without blocking. Returns the element, or `null` if the buffer is empty. Thread-safe; multiple consumer threads may call this concurrently.

We can take elements in FIFO order from our buffer:

```scala mdoc
rb.take()  // "a"
rb.take()  // "b"
rb.take()  // "c"
rb.take()  // "d"
rb.take()  // null (buffer is empty)
```

### Checking State — `size`, `isEmpty`, `isFull`

Ring buffers provide three query methods to check their state. Note that under concurrent access, these results are **approximate** — by the time the method returns, other threads may have modified the buffer.

`SpscRingBuffer#size` — Approximate element count with this signature:

```scala
final class SpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def size: Int
}
```

Returns the approximate number of elements currently in the buffer. Under concurrent access, the result may be stale. O(1).

`SpscRingBuffer#isEmpty` — Check if empty with this signature:

```scala
final class SpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def isEmpty: Boolean
}
```

Returns `true` if the buffer contains no elements (approximate). O(1).

`SpscRingBuffer#isFull` — Check if full with this signature:

```scala
final class SpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def isFull: Boolean
}
```

Returns `true` if the buffer is at capacity (approximate). O(1).

All four implementations provide the same three methods. We can check state after operations:

```scala mdoc:silent:reset
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.SpscRingBuffer

val rb2 = SpscRingBuffer[String](8)
```

State queries are cheap but approximate under concurrency:

```scala mdoc
rb2.offer("x")
rb2.offer("y")

rb2.size      // 2
rb2.isEmpty   // false
rb2.isFull    // false
```

### Batch Operations — `drain` and `fill`

`SpscRingBuffer` provides `drain` and `fill` for batch operations, optimized for the single-threaded case. `MpscRingBuffer` also provides `drain` for batch consumption.

`SpscRingBuffer#drain` — Consume up to N elements (SPSC) with this signature:

```scala
final class SpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def drain(consumer: A => Unit, limit: Int): Int
}
```

Removes up to `limit` elements from the buffer, passing each to the `consumer` callback. Returns the number of elements actually drained. Throws `IllegalArgumentException` if `limit` is negative. Must be called from the consumer thread only. O(n) where n is the number of elements drained.

`MpscRingBuffer#drain` — Consume up to N elements (MPSC) with this signature:

```scala
final class MpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def drain(consumer: A => Unit, limit: Int): Int
}
```

Removes up to `limit` elements from the buffer, passing each to the `consumer` callback. Returns the number of elements actually drained. Throws `IllegalArgumentException` if `limit` is negative. Must be called from the consumer thread only. O(n) where n is the number of elements drained.

**Note**: Uses relaxed poll semantics and stops at the first `null` slot, which may indicate either an empty buffer or a producer that has claimed a slot but has not yet written its element (mid-write). In the mid-write case, fewer than `limit` elements are returned even though more elements will become available shortly.

`SpscRingBuffer#fill` — Produce up to N elements with this signature:

```scala
final class SpscRingBuffer[A <: AnyRef](val capacity: Int) {
  def fill(supplier: () => A, limit: Int): Int
}
```

Inserts up to `limit` elements by calling the `supplier` for each new element. Returns the number of elements actually inserted. Throws `IllegalArgumentException` if `limit` is negative. Must be called from the producer thread only. O(n) where n is the number of elements inserted.

Batch operations help amortize synchronization costs. We can drain multiple elements at once:

```scala mdoc:silent:reset
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.SpscRingBuffer

val rb3 = SpscRingBuffer[java.lang.Integer](16)
(1 to 5).foreach(i => rb3.offer(Integer.valueOf(i)))

val collected = scala.collection.mutable.Buffer[java.lang.Integer]()
val drained = rb3.drain(collected += _, 10)  // drained = 5

println(s"Drained items: ${collected.mkString(", ")}")
```

Fill avoids repeated `offer` calls when producing elements:

```scala mdoc:silent:reset
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.SpscRingBuffer

val rb4 = SpscRingBuffer[String](8)
var counter = 0
val filled = rb4.fill(() => { counter += 1; s"item-$counter" }, 5)  // filled = 5

println(s"Filled $filled items")
```

## Thread Safety and Correctness

Ring buffers are **lock-free** but must be used correctly:

- **Wrong thread access causes undefined behavior**: Using `SpscRingBuffer` from multiple producer threads results in data races, silent data loss, or crashes. Always use the implementation matching your thread pattern.
- **`SpscRingBuffer#offer` and `SpscRingBuffer#take` thread contract**: The producer thread must be the sole caller of `offer`; the consumer thread must be the sole caller of `take`. They may be the same physical thread (as in single-threaded environments like Scala.js or unit tests) or different threads.
- **State queries are approximate**: Under concurrency, `SpscRingBuffer#size`, `SpscRingBuffer#isEmpty`, and `SpscRingBuffer#isFull` may be stale by the time they return. Do not rely on them for exact synchronization — use `SpscRingBuffer#offer`'s return value for backpressure instead.
- **Null elements are forbidden**: All implementations reject `null` with `NullPointerException`. If you need to store nullable values, wrap them in `Option` or another container.

:::warning
**Critical:** Ring buffers do not enforce thread-safety at runtime. Using the wrong implementation for your thread pattern or calling methods from the wrong thread **does not throw an exception** — it silently corrupts data. Test thoroughly and document your threading contract.

## Advanced Usage: Cache-Line Padding

Ring buffers use **cache-line padding** to prevent false sharing between producer and consumer indices on modern CPUs. The padding is transparent to users but enables dramatically lower latency on multi-core systems.

Each implementation pads its internal index fields (producer index, consumer index) to occupy a full cache line (128 bytes on Apple Silicon, 64 bytes on most other architectures). This ensures that when one thread reads its index, it does not invalidate the cache line holding the other thread's index, eliminating costly cache-coherency traffic.

This optimization is automatic and requires no configuration. Ring buffers are inherently more efficient than comparable Scala and Java implementations because of this padding.

## Designing With Ring Buffers

Common patterns for using ring buffers include:

### Pattern: Producer-Consumer Pipeline

Ring buffers form the backbone of producer-consumer pipelines where one or more producers generate work and one or more consumers process it:

```
┌──────────┐       ┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────┐
│Producer 1├──────>│ RingBuffer   │<──────┤Consumer 1│
│Producer 2├──────>│ (MPMC, cap=N)│<──────┤Consumer 2│
└──────────┘       └──────────────┘       └──────────┘
```

In this pattern:
- Producers call `MpmcRingBuffer#offer` and handle backpressure if `false` is returned (e.g., retry, queue internally, apply rate limiting).
- Consumers call `MpmcRingBuffer#take` in a tight loop, checking for `null` to detect empty buffers.
- Ring buffer capacity bounds memory and provides natural backpressure.

### Pattern: Batch Processing

For workloads where producers batch elements together, use `SpscRingBuffer#fill` (SPSC) or `SpscRingBuffer#offer` in a loop:

```
Producer fills batch of N items
         ↓
   Ring Buffer (growing)
         ↓
Consumer drain()s batch of M items
         ↓
     Process batch
```

Batching reduces per-element synchronization costs.

### Pattern: Work Stealing with Multiple Consumers (MPMC)

When multiple workers consume from the same queue, use `MpmcRingBuffer`. Each worker calls `MpmcRingBuffer#take` to grab the next item atomically:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.blocks.ringbuffer.MpmcRingBuffer

case class Task(id: Int, work: String)

val queue = MpmcRingBuffer[Task](256)

def worker(): Unit = {
  while (true) {
    val task = queue.take()
    if (task ne null) {
      println(s"Processing: ${task.work}")
    }
  }
}
```

The CAS loop in `MpmcRingBuffer#take` ensures no two workers grab the same task.

## Performance Characteristics

All ring buffer implementations provide O(1) time complexity for `offer`, `take`, `size`, `isEmpty`, and `isFull` operations.

- **SPSC** (FastFlow) — Fastest: avoids volatile reads on the fast path, minimal cache traffic
- **SPMC** — Fast: producer uses index-based checking; consumers CAS on a shared index
- **MPSC** — Fast: producers CAS on a shared index with a cached limit; consumer uses simple index reads
- **MPMC** — Slightly slower: uses sequence buffer stamps for coordination; all indices use CAS

Actual performance depends on:
- **CPU cache architecture** — 64-byte vs 128-byte cache lines affect padding efficiency
- **Contention level** — high contention increases CAS failure rates and retries
- **Element size** — larger elements may affect cache locality
- **Platform** — JVM JIT warmup, Scala.js compiled code, GraalVM-generated native image

Micro-benchmark your specific workload if latency is critical.

## Integration with Other ZIO Blocks Types

Ring buffers are standalone data structures and do not depend on other ZIO Blocks types. However, they integrate well with:

- **Threading models**: Ring buffers work on raw JVM threads, virtual threads (Loom), or platform-specific threads. Pair with `ZIO.fork` or `Thread` as needed.
- **Reactive streams**: Ring buffers can back reactive sources, where producers feed a `Source` and consumers pull from it. The ring buffer provides natural backpressure via `offer`'s return value.
- **Event loops**: In game engines or event-driven systems, ring buffers connect event producers (input, network) to event dispatchers (main loop) with predictable latency.
