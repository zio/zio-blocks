title: "SQL Transactions: Isolation, Savepoints & Hikari on Loom"
---

This guide covers ZIO Blocks' SQL transaction system: how `transact` works under the hood, which isolation levels are available on each database, how nested transactions use savepoints, and how to wire HikariCP into a `JdbcTransactor` for virtual-thread-friendly connection pooling.

**What we'll cover:**

- Opening transactions with `transactor.transact { ... }` and tuning isolation + readOnly
- The `TransactionIsolation` enum and how SQLite vs PostgreSQL handle each level
- Nested transactions via SQL savepoints (`zib_tx_1 .. zib_tx_N`)
- Error semantics: inner rollback vs outer commit
- HikariCP connection pooling with `JdbcTransactor.fromDataSource`
- Virtual threads (JDK 25+ Loom): why blocking JDBC is fine, and what pinning caveats remain

## Basic Usage

Every database interaction goes through a `Transactor`. The simplest form opens a connection, disables auto-commit, runs your code, and commits on success (or rolls back on failure):

```scala
transactor.transact {
  sql"INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice')".update
  sql"INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total) VALUES (1, 99.50)".update
}
```

Both inserts run inside a single transaction. If either fails, both are rolled back.

To control isolation level and read-only mode, pass them explicitly:

```scala
transactor.transact(TransactionIsolation.RepeatableRead, readOnly = false) {
  val users = sql"SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true".query[User].toList
  // ... process users ...
}
```

The default overload uses `Serializable` isolation with `readOnly = false`, which matches the standard SQL default for transactional databases.

## TransactionIsolation

The `TransactionIsolation` enum has four values, each mapping to the corresponding `java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_*` constant:

| Enum value           | JDBC constant                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ReadUncommitted`    | `TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED`       |
| `ReadCommitted`      | `TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED`         |
| `RepeatableRead`     | `TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ`        |
| `Serializable`       | `TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE`           |

When you pass a level to `transactor.transact`, it calls `Connection.setTransactionIsolation` before starting the transaction. The previous level is restored in a `finally` block after the transaction completes.

### SQLite vs PostgreSQL

The two supported dialects differ significantly in how they honor isolation levels:

| Level              | PostgreSQL                        | SQLite                                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `ReadUncommitted`  | Full support (dirty reads)        | Accepted, treated as `SERIALIZABLE`       |
| `ReadCommitted`    | Full support (default PG level)   | Accepted, treated as `SERIALIZABLE`       |
| `RepeatableRead`   | Full support (MVCC snapshot)      | Accepted, treated as `SERIALIZABLE`       |
| `Serializable`     | Full support (SSI)                | Native (default and only true level)      |

SQLite natively supports only `SERIALIZABLE`. The driver accepts the `setTransactionIsolation` call without error, but the engine ignores the requested level and behaves as serializable. This is a SQLite limitation, not a ZIO Blocks one. If your application relies on weaker isolation guarantees (e.g., `ReadCommitted` for higher concurrency), test on PostgreSQL where those semantics are real.

PostgreSQL supports all four levels natively through its MVCC implementation. `ReadCommitted` is the default for non-transactional statements; `RepeatableRead` gives you a consistent snapshot for the duration of the transaction; `Serializable` adds serialization conflict detection via Snapshot Isolation (SSI).

## Read-Only Transactions

Passing `readOnly = true` marks the connection as read-only at the JDBC level:

```scala
transactor.transact(TransactionIsolation.ReadCommitted, readOnly = true) {
  sql"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users".query[Int].toOne
}
```

PostgreSQL uses the read-only flag to enable optimization paths (e.g., avoiding WAL writes for read-only transactions). SQLite may ignore the flag depending on the driver version, but it's still set on the connection for consistency. The previous `readOnly` value is always restored after the transaction, regardless of dialect.

## Nested Transactions via Savepoints

Nested transactions are emulated via SQL savepoints on the same JDBC connection. When you're already inside `transactor.transact { ... }`, you can nest further work using the ambient `DbTx`:

```scala
transactor.transact {
  sql"INSERT INTO orders (total) VALUES (100)".update

  summon[DbTx].transact {
    sql"INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id) VALUES (1, 42)".update
  }

  sql"UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE product_id = 42".update
}
```

The nested block runs inside a savepoint named `zib_tx_1`. If it fails, only the inner work is rolled back (via `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`). The outer transaction continues and can still commit.

### How Savepoints Work

Each nesting level gets a savepoint name derived from the current depth: `zib_tx_1`, `zib_tx_2`, and so on. The mechanism:

1. **Depth increments** before creating the savepoint
2. **`SAVEPOINT zib_tx_<depth>`** is issued on the connection
3. The nested body executes with the ambient `DbTx` in scope
4. On **success**: `RELEASE SAVEPOINT zib_tx_<depth>` is called
5. On **failure**: `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT zib_tx_<depth>` is called, then the exception is rethrown
6. **Depth decrements** in a `finally` block, guaranteeing the counter resets even after exceptions

The depth counter resets after each inner block finishes, so sibling nested transactions reuse the same name sequence without leaking savepoints.

### Three-Level Example

```scala
transactor.transact {
  // Depth 0: outer transaction (real COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
  sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (1)".update

  summon[DbTx].transact {
    // Depth 1: savepoint zib_tx_1
    sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (2)".update

    summon[DbTx].transact {
      // Depth 2: savepoint zib_tx_2
      sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (3)".update
    }
    // zib_tx_2 released here

    sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (4)".update
  }
  // zib_tx_1 released here

  sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (5)".update
}
// COMMIT (all 5 inserts)
```

If the depth-2 block fails, only `INSERT INTO t VALUES (3)` is rolled back. Inserts 1, 2, 4, and 5 remain and will be committed.

### Error Semantics

When an inner block throws:

- The inner savepoint is rolled back via `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`
- The exception is rethrown to the caller
- The outer transaction is **not** rolled back automatically
- The outer block can catch the exception and continue, or let it propagate (triggering a full rollback at the top level)

```scala
transactor.transact {
  sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (1)".update

  try {
    summon[DbTx].transact {
      sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (2)".update
      throw new RuntimeException("inner failure")
      sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (3)".update  // never reached
    }
  } catch {
    case _: RuntimeException => ()  // swallow inner failure
  }

  sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (4)".update
}
// COMMIT: rows 1 and 4 only (row 2 rolled back by savepoint)
```

### The `transactNested` Helper

For call sites that prefer `using` parameters over extension receivers, `transactNested` is available as an alias:

```scala
import zio.blocks.sql.DbTx

transactor.transact {
  DbTx.transactNested {
    // same as summon[DbTx].transact { ... }
    sql"INSERT INTO t VALUES (1)".update
  }
}
```

Both forms are equivalent. The extension method (`summon[DbTx].transact { ... }`) is more common in practice because it reads naturally inside a `transact` block.

### Given-Priority Trick

When a `DbTx` is already in scope (inside `transactor.transact`), the extension `summon[DbTx].transact { ... }` resolves via the more specific `DbTx` receiver and reuses the same connection with a savepoint. Using `transactor.transact { ... }` instead would open a **new** connection, which is almost never what you want inside an existing transaction. The explicit `summon[DbTx]` form keeps semantics clear without hidden implicit resolution.

## HikariCP Recipe

For production applications, use HikariCP for connection pooling. Create a `HikariDataSource` and pass it to `JdbcTransactor.fromDataSource`:

```scala
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource
import zio.blocks.sql.{JdbcTransactor, SqlDialect}

val ds = new HikariDataSource()
ds.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb")
ds.setUsername("app_user")
ds.setPassword("secret")
ds.setMaximumPoolSize(10)

val transactor = JdbcTransactor.fromDataSource(ds, SqlDialect.PostgreSQL)
```

Convenience helpers are available for the built-in dialects:

```scala
val pgTransactor   = JdbcTransactor.postgres(ds)   // shorthand for fromDataSource(ds, PostgreSQL)
val sqliteTransactor = JdbcTransactor.sqlite(ds)    // shorthand for fromDataSource(ds, SQLite)
```

### Pool Sizing for Virtual Threads

With virtual threads (JDK 25+), the pool size rule is straightforward: **pool size equals database max connections, not thread count**. Virtual threads are cheap to create and block, so you don't need a thread pool to limit concurrency. The HikariCP pool limits how many database connections are open simultaneously, which is the only resource that actually needs capping.

A typical configuration:

```scala
ds.setMaximumPoolSize(20)   // match your DB's max_connections / app instances
ds.setMinimumIdle(5)        // keep a few warm connections
ds.setConnectionTimeout(3000) // fail fast if pool exhausted
```

Don't set `maximumPoolSize` to the number of CPU cores or virtual threads. Size it based on your database's connection limit and how many concurrent queries your application actually runs. Most applications need 10-30 connections, not thousands.

Queue sizing via `connectionTimeout` (default 30 seconds) controls how long a request waits for a pooled connection when the pool is exhausted. With virtual threads, you can afford to wait longer since you're not blocking platform threads, but 30 seconds via `ds.setConnectionTimeout(30000)` is usually a good default.

### Pinning Notes (Post-JEP491)

JEP 491 (JDK 25+) eliminates virtual-thread pinning on most blocking I/O operations. Blocking JDBC calls like `Statement.executeQuery()` no longer pin the virtual thread to its carrier thread. This means you can run thousands of concurrent queries without needing an async JDBC wrapper.

However, some drivers still have internal `synchronized` blocks or native calls that can pin:

- **SQLite driver**: The `busy_timeout` implementation uses `synchronized` internally. Under high concurrency with short timeouts, this can still pin virtual threads. Set `busy_timeout` high (e.g., 5000ms) to reduce contention, or use PostgreSQL for concurrent workloads.

- **PostgreSQL JDBC driver**: The driver's `Object.wait()` calls are safe on virtual threads post-JEP491. Earlier JDK versions (21-24) may pin during `Object.wait` in the driver's connection handshake, but this is resolved in JDK 25+.

- **HikariCP itself**: HikariCP's internal `ConcurrentBag` uses `ThreadLocal`-based tracking, which works correctly with virtual threads. The pool doesn't need special configuration for Loom.

If you're on JDK 25+, just use blocking JDBC directly. No need for `ZIO.attemptBlocking` or async wrappers to avoid pinning.

## Virtual Threads (JDK 25+ Loom)

JDK 25 brings Loom to general availability on the JVM-first path. Virtual threads handle blocking I/O naturally: when a JDBC call blocks, the virtual thread unmounts from its carrier thread and the carrier is free to run other work.

This changes the connection-pooling calculus. Before Loom, you needed to size your thread pool and connection pool carefully to avoid thread starvation. With virtual threads, the thread pool concern disappears. Your only constraint is the database's connection limit.

```scala
// No special thread pool needed. Just use virtual threads directly.
import java.util.concurrent.Executors
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext

val vtExecutor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()
val ec = ExecutionContext.fromExecutor(vtExecutor)

// Run hundreds of concurrent queries
val results = Future.traverse(userIds) { id =>
  Future {
    transactor.transact {
      sql"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $id".query[User].toOne
    }
  }(ec)
}
```

With virtual threads, you don't need async JDBC drivers, reactive wrappers, or thread pool tuning. Blocking is fine. The database connection pool is the only thing you need to manage.
