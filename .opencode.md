# OpenCode Project Guidelines

## Git and Pull Request Policy

**NEVER create a pull request without explicit user permission.**

- Do NOT run `gh pr create` unless the user explicitly asks you to create a PR
- Do NOT push to remote branches unless the user explicitly asks
- After completing work, ALWAYS ask the user if they want you to create a PR
- Committing locally is fine, but creating PRs requires explicit permission

## Example of Correct Behavior

❌ **WRONG**: Automatically creating PR after completing work
```
I've completed the implementation. Let me create a PR for you...
[creates PR without asking]
```

✅ **CORRECT**: Asking first
```
I've completed the implementation and committed the changes locally.
Would you like me to:
1. Create a pull request now?
2. Let you review the changes first?
3. Make any additional changes before creating a PR?
```

## Summary

**Key Rule**: Treat PR creation as a significant action that requires explicit user consent. When in doubt, ask first.
